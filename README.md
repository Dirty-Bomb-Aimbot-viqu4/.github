# Dirty Bomb Aimbot – Snap Headshots Like a Pro 💥🎯

## 🎯 Why Players Use It

In **Dirty Bomb**, micro-adjustments, recoil control, and tracking flying mercs or Phantom’s cloak demand solid aim. The **aimbot** offers:

* **Instant head/body lock** for consistent one-shot kills
* **Smooth aim curves** to mimic human motion
* **Triggerbot** that fires as soon as your reticle lands on a target

With stealth settings, it’s precision gaming—without drawing attention.
